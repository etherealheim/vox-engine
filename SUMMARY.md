- Implemented proper error handling and status reporting

### 2. Shared UI Components
- Created reusable components for scraper status and data statistics
- Implemented consistent UI patterns across Twitter and Vote scraper pages
- Enhanced error handling and loading states in the UI
- Added polling mechanism for real-time updates
- Created a cache management component for monitoring and controlling the database cache

### 3. Package.json Scripts
- Simplified scripts for better developer experience
- Consolidated service-specific scripts into unified commands
- Removed redundant scripts and improved naming conventions
- Added new scripts for the unified service architecture

### 4. API Routes
- Created a unified API route for scraper operations
- Implemented consistent error handling and response formats
- Added support for all required endpoints in the unified API
- Enhanced API documentation with clear endpoint descriptions
- Added cache management endpoints for monitoring and controlling the database cache

### 5. Database Utilities
- Created a centralized database utility module in `src/db/utils.js`
- Implemented connection pooling for better performance
- Added functions for common database operations
- Provided fallback mechanisms for backward compatibility
- Created a test script to verify database utility functionality
- Implemented caching layer for improved performance of frequently accessed data

### 6. Documentation
- Updated README.md with new service architecture information
- Created this service consolidation guide
- Added inline documentation for new components and services
- Created a changelog entry for the consolidation

- Consistent error handling across all services
- Better separation of concerns
- Enhanced code organization

### 4. Consistent API Structure
- Unified API routes with consistent patterns
- Standardized response formats
- Improved error handling
- Better documentation of available endpoints

### 5. Resource Efficiency
- Reduced memory usage by consolidating services
